The customer is a federal mobile operator. The mobile operator found out that many customers use archival tariffs. The task is to build a system that will offer users a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra" based on customer behavior. A model should solve classification problem and select the appropriate tariff to offer between the two.

The model metrics will be `accuracy`. Accuracy value must be at least `0.75`.
